# referralcandy-api-nodejs
A NodeJS test script to quickly explore the ReferralCandy API. Specifically, it can issue a GET to [Verify](https://www.referralcandy.com/api#verify) or a POST to [Rewards](https://www.referralcandy.com/api#post-rewards).

Just clone/download, replace the API keys in the script with your own, run `npm install` and you should be good to go!
